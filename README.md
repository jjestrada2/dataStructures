# Data Structures in JavaScript👨‍🔧

A collection of basic data structures implemented in JavaScript, including arrays, graphs, hashtables, linked lists, queues, stacks, and trees. This project demonstrates how these data structures can be created and utilized in JavaScript.

## Description🙌

This project provides implementations of fundamental data structures in JavaScript. Each data structure is implemented in its own file, with methods for common operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal.

## Installation🐢

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/datastructures.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd datastructures
    ```



## Usage🎮

Each data structure is implemented in its own file. You can include and use these data structures in your JavaScript projects as needed.

### Example Usage:🏋️

1. **Array**
    ```javascript
    const MyArray = require('./arrays');
    let array = new MyArray();
    array.push(1);
    array.push(2);
    console.log(array);
    ```

2. **Linked List**
    ```javascript
    const LinkedList = require('./linkedlist');
    let list = new LinkedList();
    list.append(1);
    list.append(2);
    console.log(list);
    ```

## Data Structures Implemented

- **Array**: Dynamic array with methods like push, pop, insert, delete, etc.
- **Graph**: Representation of graphs with methods for adding vertices, edges, and traversal.
- **Hashtable**: Hashtable with methods for setting, getting, and deleting key-value pairs.
- **Linked List**: Singly linked list with methods for insertion, deletion, and traversal.
- **Queue**: Queue with methods for enqueue, dequeue, and checking if empty.
- **Stack**: Stack with methods for push, pop, and checking if empty.
- **Tree**: Binary tree with methods for insertion, deletion, and traversal.
